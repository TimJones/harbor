# port/openstack-base*

## Function

These images contain the base images for Harbor OpenStack containers, derived weith from [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) or [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/).
Where possible images are built from Alpine Linux, though applications that require [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/), [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org) clients and/or a large number
of components that are not available in the Alpine repos use CentOS.
