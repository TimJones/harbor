# Harbor

Harbor is a distribution of the combined Kubernetes, Openstack and FreeIPA stack, from port.direct.

Harbor pre-packages all of the open source components required to build a Google-style infrastructure, that easily intergrates with your existing IT, and scales from a single laptop to the largest of data centers.
