# Harbor

Harbor is a distribution of the combined Kubernetes, Openstack and FreeIPA stack, from port.direct.

Harbor pre-packages all of the open source components required to build a Google-style infrastructure, that easily integrates with your existing IT, and scales from a single laptop to the largest of data centers.

This repo contains the Dockerfiles and build scripts for the Harbor platform containers, the [Mandracchio](https://github.com/portdirect/mandracchio) repo contains the Build script for the linux host, while the [Mulberry](https://github.com/portdirect/mulberry) repo contains deployment script and helpers.
