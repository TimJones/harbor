<p>Harbor is the Kubernetes, Openstack, Atomic Linux and FreeIPA stack from port.direct.</p>

<p>Harbor pre-packages all of the open source components required to build a modern enterprise class container infrastructure, that easily integrates with your existing IT, and scales from a single laptop to the largest of data centers. Networking is provided by OVN from the <a href="https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs">OpenvSwitch</a> project, improving both control and performance upon both the reference OpenStack and Kubernetes networking layers and allows seamless integration between the two platforms.</p>

<p>This repo contains the Dockerfiles and build scripts for the Harbor platform containers and RPM-OSTREE repository (Used by Mandracchio), the <a href="https://github.com/portdirect/mandracchio">Mandracchio</a> repo contains the Build script for the linux host, the <a href="https://github.com/portdirect/marina">Marina</a> repo contains deployment script and helpers, while the <a href="https://github.com/portdirect/intermodal">Intermodal</a> repo contains standardized container images for use within Harbor.</p>

<h2>
<a id="builds--release" class="anchor" href="#builds--release" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Builds / Release</h2>

<p>To build the images in this rep requires docker to be listening (without tls!) on 172.17.0.1, this allows the post-process scripts for Mandracchio to run and also for some build-scripts to in turn run 'sub-builds' to reduce the final image size and remove the requirement for development tools like gcc et al. to be installed within the containers. SELinux should be set to a maximum enforcement level of 'Permissive' as otherwise some things can freak out (notably SElinux labeling inside a container)</p>

<p>The built images from this repository may be found at the Port.direct <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/port/">docker hub</a>. Releases are split into two streams: 'latest' and 'stable'. 'Latest' builds for the Port.direct continuous release, while stable tracks the upstream OpenStack Release schedule and will only receive critical security updates following a release. It is strongly recommend that unless you have very specific requirements to use the the 'latest' release stream for the best experience.</p>

<h3>
<a id="openvswitch" class="anchor" href="#openvswitch" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OpenvSwitch</h3>

<p>Building containers that provide OpenvSwitch support require that a local OVS repo is running on the build host, this can be started with the following command:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>docker run -d --name openvswitch-repo -p 172.17.0.1:80:80/tcp docker.io/port/openvswitch-rpm:latest</pre></div>
